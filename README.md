Car Price Analysis

Day 1 Goal
The goal for Day 1 is to explore and understand the car dataset. This includes:

Loading the dataset and inspecting its structure, columns, and missing values.
Checking for duplicate rows and understanding basic statistics of numerical columns.
Calculating average car prices per model and per make to see which brands and models are more expensive.
Creating basic visualisations:
Bar plots of average price per car make.
Comparison of average prices by fuel type.
Scatter plots of car price vs horsepower to observe trends.
Drawing initial conclusions about factors affecting car price, including brand, fuel type, and horsepower.

Day 1 Conclusion
Summary of key findings from the initial analysis:

Average Price per Car Model and Make:

Some brands and models are significantly more expensive than others.
Creating the 'make' column helped to group models by brand for easier comparison.
Fuel Type:

Diesel cars tend to have a higher average price than petrol cars.
Horsepower vs Price:

There is a positive relationship between horsepower and price.
Higher-powered cars generally cost more.
Overall Insight:
Car price is influenced by brand, fuel type, and engine power. Understanding these factors helps in comparing different cars and identifying trends in pricing.



Day 2 Goal
The goal for Day 2 is to perform advanced analysis and visualisation of the car dataset. This includes:

Analysing correlations between numerical features and car price using a correlation heatmap.
Creating advanced scatter plots to explore how horsepower, engine size, and fuel type affect car price.
Adding regression lines to scatter plots to show trends for petrol and diesel cars.
Developing interactive visualisations using Plotly to make it easier to explore the relationships between price, horsepower, engine size, and fuel type.
Drawing conclusions from these advanced visualisations to understand the factors influencing car price more clearly.

Day 2 Conclusion
Correlation Analysis: Engine size has a strong positive correlation with price. Bigger engines usually mean higher car prices.

Scatter Plot Analysis:

Car prices increase as horsepower and engine size increase.
Petrol cars generally have higher prices overall.
Diesel car prices rise faster with higher horsepower.
Regression Lines: Confirmed the trends for petrol and diesel cars. Diesel prices increase more quickly as horsepower increases.

Interactive Plot: The Plotly scatter plot allows easy comparison of petrol vs diesel cars and shows car names when hovering for better understanding.

Overall Insight:
Car price is influenced by horsepower, engine size, and fuel type. Petrol cars are usually pricier, but diesel prices grow faster as horsepower increases. Interactive plots make these trends easier to explore and understand.
