Car Price Analysis Project Overview

This project analyses car prices in the US market to understand the factors affecting pricing. Insights help companies design cars and develop strategies that meet market demands. Key factors studied include brand, model, engine size, horsepower, and fuel type.

ETL Pipeline

Extracted dataset from Kaggle and loaded into Python.

Checked for missing values and duplicates.

Cleaned car brand names for consistency.

Applied feature engineering, including performance-to-price ratios.

Transformed dataset used for all analysis and visualisations.

Day 1: Basic Analysis

Explored the dataset and checked data quality.

Calculated average prices per car model and make.

Created basic visualisations:

Average price by brand

Average price by fuel type

Price vs horsepower scatter plot

Key Findings:

Some brands and models are more expensive.

Diesel cars generally cost more than petrol cars.

Cars with higher horsepower are usually pricier.

Day 2: Advanced Analysis

Analysed how engine size and horsepower relate to price.

Created advanced scatter plots with regression lines by fuel type.

Developed interactive Plotly plots for easier exploration.

Key Findings:

Bigger engines and higher horsepower increase prices.

Petrol cars are usually more expensive, but diesel prices rise faster with power.

Interactive plots help quickly compare cars and trends.

Extra Visualisations

Histogram of prices: Shows distribution and common price ranges.

Boxplot of price by fuel type: Compares petrol and diesel prices, highlights differences and outliers.

Interactive bar chart of average price per make: Enables easy comparison of brands.

Project Management

Tracked progress using GitHub and a Kanban board.

Tasks were organised as user stories and completed in sprints.

Regular progress reviews ensured milestones were met.

Adjusted project plan based on findings and feedback.

Reflection and Learning

Solved data cleaning and transformation challenges.

Practised feature engineering and advanced visualisation techniques.

Learned to build interactive plots and communicate insights clearly.

Improved time management and project planning skills.

Overall Conclusion

Car price is mainly influenced by brand, fuel type, engine size, and horsepower. The project provides clear insights into pricing trends and value-for-money analysis for business decisions.
