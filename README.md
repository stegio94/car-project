Car Price Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyses car prices in the US market to understand the factors affecting pricing. The insights help companies design cars and develop strategies that meet market demands. Key factors studied include brand, model, engine size, horsepower, and fuel type.

ETL Pipeline
The dataset was extracted from Kaggle and loaded into Python. Missing values and duplicates were checked, and car brands were cleaned for consistency. Feature engineering was applied to create performance-to-price ratios. The transformed dataset was then used for all analysis and visualisations.

Day 1: Basic Analysis
Explored the dataset and checked for missing data and duplicates.
Calculated average prices per car model and make.
Created basic visualisations for average price by brand, fuel type, and horsepower.

Key Findings:
Some brands and models are more expensive.
Diesel cars generally cost more than petrol cars.
Cars with higher horsepower are usually pricier.

Day 2: Advanced Analysis
Analysed how engine size and horsepower relate to price.
Created advanced scatter plots with regression lines by fuel type.
Developed interactive plots for easier exploration.

Key Findings:
Bigger engines and higher horsepower increase prices.
Petrol cars are usually more expensive, but diesel prices rise faster with power.
Interactive plots help quickly compare cars and trends.

Overall Conclusion
Car price is mainly influenced by brand, fuel type, engine size, and horsepower. The project provides clear insights into car pricing trends and value-for-money analysis for business decisions.
